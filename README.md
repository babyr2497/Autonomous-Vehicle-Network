# Decentralized Autonomous Vehicle Network

A blockchain-based platform managing autonomous vehicle operations, ride matching, payments, and maintenance through smart contracts.

## Overview

The Decentralized Autonomous Vehicle Network consists of four core smart contracts:

1. Vehicle Registration Contract
2. Ride Matching Contract
3. Payment Processing Contract
4. Maintenance Tracking Contract

## Core Features

### Vehicle Registration Contract
- Manages vehicle onboarding
- Handles vehicle credentials
- Implements compliance checks
- Manages ownership records
- Tracks vehicle status
- Handles insurance verification
- Implements safety certifications

### Ride Matching Contract
- Manages ride requests
- Implements matching algorithms
- Handles route optimization
- Manages vehicle availability
- Implements surge pricing
- Handles ride cancellations
- Manages passenger ratings

### Payment Processing Contract
- Calculates ride fares
- Handles payment processing
- Implements surge multipliers
- Manages refund processing
- Handles split payments
- Implements tipping system
- Tracks payment history

### Maintenance Tracking Contract
- Monitors vehicle health
- Schedules maintenance
- Tracks repair history
- Manages service providers
- Implements predictive maintenance
- Handles emergency repairs
- Tracks part replacements

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Vehicle Registration Contract
```solidity
interface IVehicleRegistration {
    function registerVehicle(bytes memory vehicleData) external returns (uint256);
    function updateVehicleStatus(uint256 vehicleId, VehicleStatus status) external;
    function verifyCompliance(uint256 vehicleId) external returns (bool);
    function getVehicleDetails(uint256 vehicleId) external view returns (VehicleDetails memory);
}
```

### Ride Matching Contract
```solidity
interface IRideMatching {
    function requestRide(RideRequest memory request) external returns (uint256);
    function acceptRide(uint256 rideId) external;
    function cancelRide(uint256 rideId) external;
    function completeRide(uint256 rideId) external;
}
```

### Payment Processing Contract
```solidity
interface IPaymentProcessing {
    function calculateFare(uint256 rideId) external view returns (uint256);
    function processPayment(uint256 rideId) external;
    function refundPayment(uint256 rideId) external;
    function processTip(uint256 rideId, uint256 amount) external;
}
```

### Maintenance Tracking Contract
```solidity
interface IMaintenanceTracking {
    function logMaintenance(uint256 vehicleId, bytes memory data) external;
    function scheduleService(uint256 vehicleId, ServiceType serviceType) external;
    function completeService(uint256 serviceId) external;
    function getMaintenanceHistory(uint256 vehicleId) external view returns (Service[] memory);
}
```
